# 👋 Hi, I’m @Zain999-hub

By day, I am dedicated to building AI models that contribute to society, focusing on solving real-world problems using machine learning and deep learning. At night, I pursue my passion for ethical hacking, exploring the ever-evolving world of cybersecurity and forensic computing.

- 👀 I’m interested in **full-stack development, ethical hacking, AI model development, and open-source projects.**

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on **AI-driven projects, ethical hacking challenges, and community-driven tech initiatives**

- 📫 How to reach me **(zeynabbadawi111@gmail.com) or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zainab-badawi)**

- 😄 Pronouns: **She/Her**

- ⚡ Fun fact: **When I’m not building AI models or hacking systems, you can find me horseback riding or smashing shuttlecocks on the badminton court! Who says techies can’t be sporty too?**
